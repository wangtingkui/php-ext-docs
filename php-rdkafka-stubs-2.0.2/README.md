$ composer require kwn/php-rdkafka-stubs --dev
```

## Usage

Once package is installed, your IDE should simply discover all stubs automatically. Please notice, that `kwn/php-rdkafka-stubs`
package has no autoloader configuration provided, so stubs classes are visible in your IDE, but don't clashes with `rdkafka`
extension namespaces.
